I asked Nous Hermes Theta about the zip code where I live, and it proceded to get the city wrong and tell me

```sh
‚ùØ toolio_request --apibase="http://localhost:8000" \

Let's make sure it has up to date info.

```sh
‚ùØ python demo/zipcode.py
‚öôÔ∏è Calling tool zip_code_info with args {'code': '80027'}
‚öôÔ∏è Tool call result: LOUISVILLE, CO, US
Here are some details about life in the 80027 zip code, which is located in Louisville, Colorado:

Cuts off for max length, but we've accomplished what we wanted. Well, except that I actually live in Superior
(which shares a zip with Louisville), but that's a nitpick for another project. üòâ
