Toolio is an OpenAI-like HTTP server API that supports structured LLM response generation (e.g., conforming to a JSON schema), designed for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs) using the [MLX project](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx).

## Structured Control for Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but complex machines that generate text based on input prompts. While this simplicity is convenient for casual use, it can be a significant limitation when precise, structured outputs are required. Enter Toolio, an open-source project designed to provide developers with fine-grained control over LLM responses.

### The Challenge of LLM Control

Imagine a soccer coach who only gives a pep talk and instructions at the start of the game, and then leaves. The team with a coach actively guiding them throughout the match is far more likely to succeed. Similarly, relying solely on initial prompts for LLMs can lead to unpredictable results, especially when generating code, interacting with other applications, or producing specialized content.

Toolio acts as that crucial sideline coach for your LLM interactions. It provides a framework for implementing in-process controls, allowing you to guide the LLM's output with precision. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where adherence to specific structures are paramount. To be more specific, Toolio supports structural output enforcement by allowing you to specify JSON schemata which guide the output.

As LLMs become increasingly integrated into high-stakes productivity tools, the ability to control and constrain their outputs becomes crucial. Toolio provides developers with the tools they need to harness the power of LLMs while maintaining the precision and reliability required to support complex workflows.

Whether you're building a specialized AI assistant, automating content creation, integrating LLMs into your data analysis pipeline, or developing new ways for LLMs to interact with the world, Toolio offers the flexibility and control you need to deliver consistent, high-quality results, a strong foundation for pushing the boundaries of AI software development.

## Empowering Local LLMs with Agentic Capabilities

Structured outputs are the cornerstone of Toolio, and one of the most useful applications of this is in tool-calling, where LLMs can generate requests to tools (functions) specified through the prompt. Toolio allows you to create LLM agentic frameworks, bridging the gap between language models and practical, real-world actions. EVen cooler, Toolio allows you to do this with private, locally-hosted models.

Agentic frameworks allow LLMs to interact with external tools and APIs, greatly expanding their capabilities beyond mere text generation. These frameworks enable LLMs to:

1. Recognize when external tools are needed to complete a task
2. Select the appropriate tool from a predefined set
3. Formulate the correct inputs for the chosen tool
4. Interpret and incorporate the tool's output into their response

### Tool Calling with Toolio

Toolio's implementation of tool-calling for locally-hosted LLMs opens up a world of possibilities:

1. **Enhanced Decision Making**: LLMs can access up-to-date information, perform calculations, or query databases to inform their responses.
2. **Task Automation**: Complex workflows involving multiple steps and tools can be orchestrated by the LLM.
3. **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging specialized tools, LLMs can provide more precise and reliable information.
4. **Local Control and Privacy**: Unlike cloud-based solutions, Toolio's local approach ensures data privacy and reduces latency. Open Source AI resources. Self-hosted Open Source AI models & tools form your GPT Private Agent, handling intelligent tasks for you, without spilling your secrets.

### On the shoulders of giants

* Toolio began as a fork of the [LLM Structured Output project](https://github.com/otriscon/llm-structured-output), which is still, through explicit dependency, still key to what makes Toolio tick.
